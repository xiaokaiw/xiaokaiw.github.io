I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan, working under the supervision of Prof. Zhongming Liu. I completed my master's studies at Johns Hopkins University, working under the supervision of Prof. Jerry Prince.  I'm interested in studying gut-brain interaction using magnetic resonance imaging, machine learning, and electrophysiology.
